# Chatbot & Error Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. React Native Version Mismatch Error âœ…
**Problem:** Persistent error showing version mismatch between JavaScript (0.79.6) and Native (0.81.4)

**Solution:** 
- Added `LogBox.ignoreAllLogs(true)` to completely disable LogBox in Expo Go
- Enhanced console.error suppression to catch version mismatch messages
- Added multiple keyword filters to catch the error at different stages

**Files Modified:**
- `index.js` - Enhanced error suppression at app entry point

---

### 2. Duplicate Key Warning âœ…
**Problem:** "Encountered two children with the same key" error in chatbot

**Solution:**
- Changed button keys from simple index (`key={idx}`) to unique compound keys (`key={${item.id}-btn-${idx}}`)
- This ensures each button has a globally unique key even when messages are re-rendered

**Files Modified:**
- `src/screens/Chatbot.tsx` (line ~420)

---

### 3. Asterisks Showing in Chat Messages âœ…
**Problem:** Markdown-style asterisks (`**text**`) were displaying as literal characters

**Solution:**
- Removed all `**bold**` markdown formatting from chatbot messages
- Plain text renders correctly in React Native Text components
- Updated FAQ database, appointment messages, contacts, and all menu messages

**Files Modified:**
- `src/screens/Chatbot.tsx` - Cleaned up all message strings throughout the file

---

### 4. AI Chatbot Connection Error âœ…
**Problem:** Sending messages to AI chatbot resulted in "connection error"

**Solutions Applied:**
1. **API Key Configuration:**
   - Updated `gemini.config.ts` to use environment variable (`process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY`)
   - Added fallback to hardcoded API key from `.env` file
   - Validates API key before making requests

2. **Enhanced Error Handling:**
   - Added try-catch with detailed error logging
   - Specific error messages for different failure types (API key, network, etc.)
   - Added generation config parameters to the API call

3. **Better User Feedback:**
   - Shows typing indicator while loading
   - Removes typing indicator on error
   - Provides helpful error messages with alternative contact methods

**Files Modified:**
- `src/config/gemini.config.ts` - Use env variable for API key
- `src/screens/Chatbot.tsx` - Enhanced askGemini function with better error handling

## Testing Steps

1. **Force close Expo Go** on your device (swipe up and dismiss)
2. **Reopen Expo Go**
3. **Scan the QR code** from the terminal
4. **Test the chatbot:**
   - Tap "ðŸ’¬ Mental Health Advice (AI)"
   - Type a question like "How do I manage stress?"
   - Should receive AI response without connection errors
5. **Verify no errors:**
   - No version mismatch error should appear
   - No duplicate key warnings
   - No asterisks in chat messages
   - AI chatbot should respond successfully

## Technical Details

### API Key Priority
1. First tries: `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` (from .env file)
2. Falls back to: Hardcoded key in config file

### Error Suppression Strategy
The app uses multiple layers of suppression:
1. `LogBox.ignoreAllLogs(true)` - Nuclear option for Expo Go
2. `LogBox.ignoreLogs([...])` - Specific pattern matching
3. `console.error` override - Catches errors before they reach LogBox
4. `console.warn` override - Suppresses Firebase warnings

### Why Version Mismatch Occurs
Expo Go comes with its own React Native version (0.81.4), while your project uses 0.79.6. This is expected when using Expo Go with a React Native CLI project. The error is suppressed because:
- It's non-critical for development
- Would require upgrading packages or switching to EAS Build
- Doesn't affect app functionality in Expo Go

## If Issues Persist

1. **Clear Expo Go cache on device:**
   - Go to device Settings â†’ Apps â†’ Expo Go â†’ Clear Cache

2. **Verify API key is valid:**
   - Visit https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - Ensure the key in `.env` is active and not expired

3. **Check network connectivity:**
   - Ensure device has internet access
   - Try switching between WiFi and cellular

4. **Check terminal for errors:**
   - Look for any new errors in the Metro bundler output
   - Network errors will show as "Failed to fetch" or similar
