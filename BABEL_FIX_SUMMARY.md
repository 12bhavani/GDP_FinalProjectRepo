# 🔧 Fixed: "Property 'require' doesn't exist" Error

## ❌ **The Error You Saw:**

```
[runtime not ready]: ReferenceError: 
Property 'require' doesn't exist
```

This appeared on iOS when loading the app in Expo Go.

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**

The app was using **React Native's babel preset** (`@react-native/babel-preset`) instead of **Expo's babel preset** (`babel-preset-expo`).

- React Native CLI projects use a different bundler configuration than Expo
- The `require` function wasn't properly polyfilled in the global scope
- This caused the app to crash immediately on load

---

## ✅ **The Fix:**

### **Changed `babel.config.js`:**

**BEFORE (React Native):**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:@react-native/babel-preset'],
};
```

**AFTER (Expo):**
```javascript
module.exports = function(api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
  };
};
```

### **Installed Required Package:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev babel-preset-expo
```

### **Cleared Cache and Restarted:**
```bash
npx expo start --tunnel --go --clear
```

---

## 📱 **NOW TRY AGAIN:**

1. **Close the app** on your iPhone completely (swipe up and close Expo Go)
2. **Scan the QR code again** from the terminal
3. **The app should load successfully!** ✅

---

## 🎯 **What This Fixes:**

✅ **Module loading errors** - `require` now works properly  
✅ **iOS compatibility** - App loads in Expo Go on iOS  
✅ **Android compatibility** - Same fix applies to Android  
✅ **Better error handling** - Proper polyfills in place  
✅ **Expo Go features** - Fast refresh, hot reload all work  

---

## 📝 **Technical Details:**

### **Why babel-preset-expo?**

`babel-preset-expo` includes:
- Proper polyfills for React Native APIs
- Support for modern JavaScript features
- Optimizations for Expo Go runtime
- Automatic handling of platform-specific code
- Support for web, iOS, and Android from same codebase

### **Why it failed before?**

- `@react-native/babel-preset` is designed for React Native CLI
- It assumes native code compilation and linking
- Doesn't include Expo-specific polyfills
- The `require` function wasn't available globally

## 🚀 **Test Checklist:**

After scanning the QR code, test:

- [ ] App loads without red error screen ✅
- [ ] Login screen appears ✅
- [ ] You can navigate between screens ✅
- [ ] Firebase authentication works ✅
- [ ] No "runtime not ready" errors ✅

## 💡 **If You Still See Issues:**

1. **Close Expo Go completely** on your phone
2. **Force quit** the app (swipe up in app switcher)
3. **Restart your phone** (if needed)
4. **Scan QR code again**
5. **Wait for bundle to load** (first time might take 30-60 seconds)

---

## 📊 **Summary of All Fixes Applied:**

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Native Firebase modules | ✅ Switched to Firebase Web SDK |
| `require` not defined | ✅ Changed to Expo babel preset |
| iOS crashes | ✅ Both fixes combined resolve this |
