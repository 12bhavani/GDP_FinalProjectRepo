I'm here to provide support. Ask me about:
• Stress management
• Anxiety or depression
• Coping strategies

Type your question below:

User: "I'm feeling overwhelmed with exams"

Bot: [Gemini AI Response]
I understand exam season can be really stressful. Here are some strategies that might help:

1. **Break it down**: Instead of looking at all exams at once, focus on one subject at a time...

2. **Take regular breaks**: The Pomodoro Technique (25 min study, 5 min break) can help maintain focus...

3. **Practice self-care**: Ensure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and taking short walks...

Remember, the Wellness Services counselors are here to help. Call 660.562.1348 for support.
